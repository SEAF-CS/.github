### Short Summary

The Cockburn SEAF initiative started as part of the [WAMSI-Westport Marine Science Program (WWMSP)](https://wamsi.org.au/projects/cockburn-sound/) with the aim to develop a coordinated platform for the integration of environmental data and modelling work relevant to studying the Cockburn Sound ecosystem (Perth, Western Australia). This was developed to support analytics activities of the WWMSP, and to build a repository of tools and datasets able to be used into the future by scientists, government and consultants. 

Data-sets within the platform range from high-frequency current and wave data, to historical water quality data from government and industry led projects, and also a curation of satellite data specific to the region. The core of the platform is an integrated hydrodynamic-ecological model termed "**CSIEM**".

Users of the platform can gain access to the models and simulate any years between 1993 and 2024. To enable application of the model for port design scenarios and environmental impact assessment, these repositories can be used with the associated "SEAF platform" for using the data and modelling tools has been developed within the cloud environment.

For further information, please refer to our evolving [CSIEM manual](https://seaf-cs.github.io/csiem-science/) which describes the system.
