### Short Summary

The Cockburn SEAF initiative started as part of the WAMSI-Westport Marine Science Program (WWMSP) with the aim to develop a coordinated platform for the integration of diverse data and modelling work relevant to Cockburn Sound environmental assessment. This was developed to support activities of the program, but also to build a legacy of tools and datasets able to be used into the future by scientists, government and consultants. 

Data-sets within the platform range from high-frequency current and wave data, to historical water quality data from government and industry led projects, and also a curation of satellite data specific to the region. Having the combination of public and private data together in a common platform has helped guide model development and validation and improve our overall understanding of trends and patterns.

Users of the platform can gain access to the models and simulate any years between 1993 and 2024. To enable application of the model for port design scenarios and environmental impact assessment, these repositories can be used with the associated "SEAF platform" for using the data and modelling tools has been developed within the cloud environment.
